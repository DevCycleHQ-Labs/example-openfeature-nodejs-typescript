# DevCycle OpenFeature NodeJS Server SDK Example App (Typescript)

An example app built using the [OpenFeature Node.js SDK](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/server/javascript)
and [DevCycle Node.js Server SDK](https://docs.devcycle.com/sdk/server-side-sdks/node/) with TypeScript.

## Creating a Demo Feature
This example app requires that your project has a feature with the expected variables, as well as some simple targeting rules. 

#### ⇨ [Click here](https://app.devcycle.com/r/create?resource=feature&key=hello-togglebot) to automatically create the feature in your project ⇦

When you run the example app and switch your identity between users, you'll be able to see the feature's different variations.
